    <p>I'm really glad that I made the decision to learn programming. I'm enjoying it a lot. It's not as hard as I thought it was, and I can see myself doing really well with this. I'm excided for all the possible opportunities out there. Alothough I do struggle sometimes, I will make a promise to myself to push through and work even harder.</p>

    <p>I only wish I had known to pursue coding earlier. Sometimes I feel like so much time was wasted and lost, but I will not let those negative thoughts defeat me. I have the future ahead of me. I will work harder and become an even better person. I know I am capable of achieving everything I was meant to be. Through persistance and hard work, I will accomplish great things.</p>
